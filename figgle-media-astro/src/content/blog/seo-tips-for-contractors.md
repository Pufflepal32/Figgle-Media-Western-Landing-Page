If you're a contractor, you know that word-of-mouth referrals are gold. But in today's digital world, most homeowners start their search for a contractor on Google. Here are five SEO tips that can help your construction company get found online.

## 1. Claim and Optimize Your Google Business Profile

Your Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) is one of the most important tools for local contractors. When someone searches "roofer near me" or "plumber in [city]," Google's local pack results often appear first.

**To optimize your profile:**
- Ensure your business name, address, and phone number are accurate
- Add high-quality photos of your work
- Choose the right business categories
- Encourage customers to leave reviews
- Post updates regularly

## 2. Target Location-Specific Keywords

Generic keywords like "roofing company" are highly competitive. Instead, focus on location-specific terms that your actual customers use.

**Examples:**
- "Roof repair in [your city]"
- "[neighborhood] plumber"
- "HVAC installation [county name]"

Create dedicated pages for each service area you cover.

## 3. Build Citations Consistently

Citations are mentions of your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) across the web. Search engines use these to verify your business information.

**Key citation sources for contractors:**
- Yelp
- Angi (formerly Angie's List)
- HomeAdvisor
- BBB
- Local chamber of commerce
- Industry-specific directories

Make sure your NAP is identical everywhere.

## 4. Create Service Pages That Convert

Don't just list your services on one page. Create individual, detailed pages for each service you offer. Each page should:

- Target specific keywords
- Explain the service in detail
- Include photos of your work
- Answer common questions
- Have a clear call-to-action

## 5. Get Reviews and Respond to Them

Reviews are a ranking factor and a trust factor. They help you show up in search results AND convince potential customers to choose you.

**Tips for getting more reviews:**
- Ask satisfied customers directly
- Make it easy with a direct link
- Follow up after job completion
- Respond to every review, positive or negative
